 ### Build a secure API for a food reviews app

## languages and tools

#### HTML5 / CSS3 / JS
#### front end: Angular
#### back end: Node.Js / Express / MongoDb

## Scenario and requirements

Last week, you received a message on your freelance platform asking for help with a new project.  
Hot sauces are growing in popularity, thanks in large part to the "Hot Ones" YouTube series.  
That's why this new client, the brand of chili-based condiments Piiquante, wants to develop a hot sauce review web application called "Hot Takes".   

If Piiquante's product manager wants to eventually turn the review app into an online store,  
she wants the first version to be a "sauce gallery" allowing users to upload their favorite hot sauces and like or dislike them.      
The app's front-end was developed using Angular and was pre-compiled after internal testing,   
but Piiquante needs a back-end developer to build the API.   

The deadline is reasonable, so you decide to accept the project.   
After meeting Paula, the product manager of Piiquante, she sends you the following email:

 

  From: Paula Z   
  To: You   
  Subject: Requirements for the API   

  Good morning,   

  We are delighted that you are contributing to this new web application!   
  We are a small brand, so this project will have a big impact on our growth.   

  Attached are the specifications for the API.   
  You will also find a link to the project repo [here](https://github.com/OpenClassrooms-Student-Center/Web-Developer-P6) where you will have access to the interface.   

  Please pay particular attention to the security requirements.   
  We have recently been victims of attacks on our website and we want to be sure that the API of this application is built according to secure code practices.    
  All user passwords collected by the application must be protected!   

  Cordially,   

  Paula Z  
  product manager   
  Spicy   


You are ready to get started with the API! Let's go !
